(For ZARX Esports Forum – Global Esports IP Website)

OBJECTIVE
Create a premium, gaming-industry level website that positions ZARX Esports Forum as:
A Global Esports IP Curator
A Competitive Ecosystem Architect
A Broadcast-First, Investor-Ready Brand
Not a service company, but a structured IP authority
The website must feel:
AAA Gaming Industry Level
High-production esports aesthetic
3D motion + LED-style animations
Purple / Violet / Baby Pink / Starlight neon palette
Investor-friendly but gamer-dominant
Modern WebGL / 3D UI inspired
🎨 DESIGN & VISUAL DIRECTION
Color Theme
Deep black base (#0A0A0F)
Violet / Purple gradients (#A020F0)
Neon Pink highlights (#FF00FF)
Lavender soft glow (#E6E6FA)
Electric baby pink accents
Subtle glassmorphism
Use this glow styling throughout:
Copy code
Css
.glow-box {
  background: linear-gradient(135deg, #A020F0, #E6E6FA);
  box-shadow: 0 0 20px #A020F0, 0 0 40px #FF00FF;
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
}
.glow-text {
  color: white;
  text-shadow: 0 0 10px #A020F0, 0 0 20px #A020F0, 0 0 30px #A020F0;

🎮 HERO SECTION (HOME PAGE)

Create a high-end animated gaming scene including:
Cyberpunk city skyline
Racing cars drifting (GTA-style vibe)
Tactical fighter silhouettes
Esports arena lighting
Subtle VR hologram effects
Slow-moving particles

The vibe should resemble high-end esports trailer visuals.
LED LOGO TICKER (BOTTOM BAND)
Create a moving LED banner at the bottom of hero section:

Slight LED glow effect
Blur reflection beneath
Include logos (monochrome white or violet-tinted):
